<p>
Using a mock location provider (by requiring the permission android.permission.ACCESS_MOCK_LOCATION) should only be done in debug builds (or from tests). In Gradle projects, that means you should only request this permission in a test or debug source set specific manifest file. 
</p>
<p>
To fix this, create a new manifest file in the debug folder and move the &lt;uses-permission&gt; element there. A typical path to a debug manifest override file in a Gradle project is src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml.
