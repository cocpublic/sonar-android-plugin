Dynamically loading code from locations other than the application's library
directory or the Android platform's built-in library directories is dangerous,
as there is an increased risk that the code could have been tampered with.
Applications should use loadLibrary when possible, which provides increased
assurance that libraries are loaded from one of these safer locations.
Application developers should use the features of their development
environment to place application native libraries into the lib directory of
their compiled APKs.
