In a &lt;tech-list&gt;, there can be whitespace around the &lt;tech&gt; elements,but not inside them. This is because the code which reads in the tech list is currently very strict and will include the whitespace as part of the name.

In other words, use &lt;tech&gt;name&lt;/tech&gt;, not &lt;tech&gt; name &lt;/tech&gt;.
