<pre>NOTE: This issue is disabled by default!
You can enable it by adding --enable TypographyQuotes

Straight single quotes and double quotes, when used as a pair, can be replaced
by "curvy quotes" (or directional quotes). This can make the text more
readable.

Note that you should never use grave accents and apostrophes to quote, `like
this'.

(Also note that you should not use curvy quotes for code fragments.)
