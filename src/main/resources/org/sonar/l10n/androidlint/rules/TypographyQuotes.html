<p>
Straight single quotes and double quotes, when used as a pair, can be replaced by &quot;curvy quotes&quot; (or directional quotes). This can make the text more readable. 
</p>
<p>
Note that you should never use grave accents and apostrophes to quote, `like this'. 
</p>
<p>
(Also note that you should not use curvy quotes for code fragments.)
