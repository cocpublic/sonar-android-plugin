Frequent alarms are bad for battery life. As of API 22, the AlarmManager will override near-future and high-frequency alarm requests, delaying the alarm at least 5 seconds into the future and ensuring that the repeat interval is at least 60 seconds.

If you really need to do work sooner than 5 seconds, post a delayed message or runnable to a Handler.
