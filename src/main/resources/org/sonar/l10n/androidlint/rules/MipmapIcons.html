Launcher icons should be provided in the mipmap resource directory. This is
the same as the drawable resource directory, except resources in the mipmap
directory will not get stripped out when creating density-specific APKs.

In certain cases, the Launcher app may use a higher resolution asset (than
would normally be computed for the device) to display large app shortcuts. If
drawables for densities other than the device's resolution have been stripped
out, then the app shortcut could appear blurry.

To fix this, move your launcher icons from `drawable-`dpi to `mipmap-`dpi and
change references from @drawable/ and R.drawable to @mipmap/ and R.mipmap.
In Android Studio this lint warning has a quickfix to perform this
automatically.
