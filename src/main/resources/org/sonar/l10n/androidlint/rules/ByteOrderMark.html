Lint will flag any byte-order-mark (BOM) characters it finds in the middle of a file. Since we expect files to be encoded with UTF-8 (see the EnforceUTF8 issue), the BOM characters are not necessary, and they are not handled correctly by all tools. For example, if you have a BOM as part of a resource name in one particular translation, that name will not be considered identical to the base resource's name and the translation will not be used.
