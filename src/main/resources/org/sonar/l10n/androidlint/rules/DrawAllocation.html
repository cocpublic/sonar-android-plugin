You should avoid allocating objects during a drawing or layout operation.
These are called frequently, so a smooth UI can be interrupted by garbage
collection pauses caused by the object allocations.

The way this is generally handled is to allocate the needed objects up front
and to reuse them for each drawing operation.

Some methods allocate memory on your behalf (such as Bitmap.create), and these
should be handled in the same way.
