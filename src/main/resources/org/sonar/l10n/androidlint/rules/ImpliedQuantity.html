Plural strings should generally include a %s or %d formatting argument. In
locales like English, the one quantity only applies to a single value, 1, but
that's not true everywhere. For example, in Slovene, the one quantity will
apply to 1, 101, 201, 301, and so on. Similarly, there are locales where
multiple values match the zero and two quantities.

In these locales, it is usually an error to have a message which does not
include a formatting argument (such as '%d'), since it will not be clear from
the grammar what quantity the quantity string is describing.
