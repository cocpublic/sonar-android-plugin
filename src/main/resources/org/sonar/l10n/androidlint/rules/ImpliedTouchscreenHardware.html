Apps require the android.hardware.touchscreen feature by default. If you want your app to be available on TV, you must also explicitly declare that a touchscreen is not required as follows: &lt;uses-feature android:name=&quot;android.hardware.touchscreen&quot; android:required=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
