Margin values should be positive. Negative values are generally a sign that you are making assumptions about views surrounding the current one, or may be tempted to turn off child clipping to allow a view to escape its parent. Turning off child clipping to do this not only leads to poor graphical performance, it also results in wrong touch event handling since touch events are based strictly on a chain of parent-rect hit tests. Finally, making assumptions about the size of strings can lead to localization problems.
