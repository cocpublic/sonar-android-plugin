<p>
Using -keepclasseswithmembernames in a proguard config file is not correct; it can cause some symbols to be renamed which should not be. Earlier versions of ADT used to create proguard.cfg files with the wrong format. Instead of -keepclasseswithmembernames use -keepclasseswithmembers, since the old flags also implies &quot;allow shrinking&quot; which means symbols only referred to from XML and not Java (such as possibly CustomViews) can get deleted.
