Using 0dp as the width in a horizontal LinearLayout with weights is a useful
trick to ensure that only the weights (and not the intrinsic sizes) are used
when sizing the children.

However, if you use 0dp for the opposite dimension, the view will be
invisible. This can happen if you change the orientation of a layout without
also flipping the 0dp dimension in all the children.
