The @IntDef annotation allows you to create a light-weight "enum" or type
definition. However, it's possible to accidentally specify the same value for
two or more of the values, which can lead to hard-to-detect bugs. This check
looks for this scenario and flags any repeated constants.

In some cases, the repeated constant is intentional (for example, renaming a
constant to a more intuitive name, and leaving the old name in place for
compatibility purposes.)  In that case, simply suppress this check by adding a
@SuppressLint("UniqueConstants") annotation.
