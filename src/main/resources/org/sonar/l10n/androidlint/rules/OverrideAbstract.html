To improve the usability of some APIs, some methods that used to be abstract
have been made concrete by adding default implementations. This means that
when compiling with new versions of the SDK, your code does not have to
override these methods.

However, if your code is also targeting older versions of the platform where
these methods were still abstract, the code will crash. You must override all
methods that used to be abstract in any versions targeted by your
application's minSdkVersion.
