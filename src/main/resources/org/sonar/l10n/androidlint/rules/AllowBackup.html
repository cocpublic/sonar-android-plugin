The allowBackup attribute determines if an application's data can be backed up
and restored. It is documented at
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to true. When this flag is set to true,
application data can be backed up and restored by the user using adb backup
and adb restore.

This may have security consequences for an application. adb backup allows
users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the
device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. adb
restore allows creation of application data from a source specified by the
user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file
permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application
itself.

Setting allowBackup="false" opts an application out of both backup and
restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup,
and explicitly set android:allowBackup=(true|false)".

If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn
that you should set android:fullBackupContent to configure auto backup.
