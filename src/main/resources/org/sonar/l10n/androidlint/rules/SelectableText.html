<pre>NOTE: This issue is disabled by default!
You can enable it by adding --enable SelectableText

If a <TextView> is used to display data, the user might want to copy that data
and paste it elsewhere. To allow this, the <TextView> should specify
android:textIsSelectable="true".

This lint check looks for TextViews which are likely to be displaying data:
views whose text is set dynamically. This value will be ignored on platforms
older than API 11, so it is okay to set it regardless of your minSdkVersion.
