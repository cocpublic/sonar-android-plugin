If a &lt;TextView&gt; is used to display data, the user might want to copy that data and paste it elsewhere. To allow this, the &lt;TextView&gt; should specify android:textIsSelectable=&quot;true&quot;.

This lint check looks for TextViews which are likely to be displaying data: views whose text is set dynamically. This value will be ignored on platforms older than API 11, so it is okay to set it regardless of your minSdkVersion.
