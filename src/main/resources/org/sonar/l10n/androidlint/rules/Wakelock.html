Failing to release a wakelock properly can keep the Android device in a high
power mode, which reduces battery life. There are several causes of this, such
as releasing the wake lock in onDestroy() instead of in onPause(), failing to
call release() in all possible code paths after an acquire(), and so on.

NOTE: If you are using the lock just to keep the screen on, you should
strongly consider using FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON instead. This window flag will be
correctly managed by the platform as the user moves between applications and
doesn't require a special permission. See
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams
.html#FLAG_KEEP_SCREEN_ON.
