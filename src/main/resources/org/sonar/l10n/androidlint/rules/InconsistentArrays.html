<p>
When an array is translated in a different locale, it should normally have the same number of elements as the original array. When adding or removing elements to an array, it is easy to forget to update all the locales, and this lint warning finds inconsistencies like these. 
</p>
<p>
Note however that there may be cases where you really want to declare a different number of array items in each configuration (for example where the array represents available options, and those options differ for different layout orientations and so on), so use your own judgement to decide if this is really an error.

You can suppress this error type if it finds false errors in your project.
