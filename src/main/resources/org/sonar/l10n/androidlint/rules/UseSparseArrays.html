For maps where the keys are of type integer, it's typically more efficient to
use the Android SparseArray API. This check identifies scenarios where you
might want to consider using SparseArray instead of HashMap for better
performance.

This is particularly useful when the value types are primitives like ints,
where you can use SparseIntArray and avoid auto-boxing the values from int to
Integer.

If you need to construct a HashMap because you need to call an API outside of
your control which requires a Map, you can suppress this warning using for
example the @SuppressLint annotation.
