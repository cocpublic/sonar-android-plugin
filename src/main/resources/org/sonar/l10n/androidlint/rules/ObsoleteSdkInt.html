This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high as the version checked for.

Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14 where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion, where the contents should be merged into the best folder.
