In Gradle projects, the actual package used in the final APK can vary; for example,you can add a .debug package suffix in one version and not the other. Therefore, you should not hardcode the application package in the resource; instead, use the special namespace http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto which will cause the tools to figure out the right namespace for the resource regardless of the actual package used during the build.
