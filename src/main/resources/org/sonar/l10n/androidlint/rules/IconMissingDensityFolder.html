Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as drawable-hdpi.

<p>
Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html
