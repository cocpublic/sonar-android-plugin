<p>
A LinearLayout which contains an ImageView and a TextView can be more efficiently handled as a compound drawable (a single TextView, using the drawableTop, drawableLeft, drawableRight and/or drawableBottom attributes to draw one or more images adjacent to the text). 
</p>
<p>
If the two widgets are offset from each other with margins, this can be replaced with a drawablePadding attribute. 
</p>
<p>
There's a lint quickfix to perform this conversion in the Eclipse plugin.
