<p>
Using showAsAction=&quot;always&quot; in menu XML, or MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS in Java code is usually a deviation from the user interface style guide.Use ifRoom or the corresponding MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM instead. 
</p>
<p>
If always is used sparingly there are usually no problems and behavior is roughly equivalent to ifRoom but with preference over other ifRoom items. Using it more than twice in the same menu is a bad idea. 
</p>
<p>
This check looks for menu XML files that contain more than two always actions, or some always actions and no ifRoom actions. In Java code, it looks for projects that contain references to MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_ALWAYS and no references to MenuItem.SHOW_AS_ACTION_IF_ROOM.
