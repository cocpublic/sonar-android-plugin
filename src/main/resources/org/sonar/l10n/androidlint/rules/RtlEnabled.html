To enable right-to-left support, when running on API 17 and higher, you must set the android:supportsRtl attribute in the manifest &lt;application&gt; element. 
</p>
<p>
If you have started adding RTL attributes, but have not yet finished the migration, you can set the attribute to false to satisfy this lint check.
