Prior to Android 4.0, the implementation of View.setTag(int, Object) would
store the objects in a static map, where the values were strongly referenced.
This means that if the object contains any references pointing back to the
context, the context (which points to pretty much everything else) will leak.
If you pass a view, the view provides a reference to the context that created
it. Similarly, view holders typically contain a view, and cursors are
sometimes also associated with views.
