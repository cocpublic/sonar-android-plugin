<pre>
Key generation, signing, encryption, and random number generation may not
receive cryptographically strong values due to improper initialization of the
underlying PRNG on Android 4.3 and below.

If your application relies on cryptographically secure random number
generation you should apply the workaround described in
https://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/08/some-securerandom-thoughts.htm
l .

This lint rule is mostly informational; it does not accurately detect whether
cryptographically secure RNG is required, or whether the workaround has
already been applied. After reading the blog entry and updating your code if
necessary, you can disable this lint issue.
