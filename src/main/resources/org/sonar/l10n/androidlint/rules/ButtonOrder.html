According to the Android Design Guide,

"Action buttons are typically Cancel and/or OK, with OK indicating the
preferred or most likely action. However, if the options consist of specific
actions such as Close or Wait rather than a confirmation or cancellation of
the action described in the content, then all the buttons should be active
verbs. As a rule, the dismissive action of a dialog is always on the left
whereas the affirmative actions are on the right."

This check looks for button bars and buttons which look like cancel buttons,
and makes sure that these are on the left.
