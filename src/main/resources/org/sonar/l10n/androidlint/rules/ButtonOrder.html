According to the Android Design Guide, 
</p>
<p>
&quot;Action buttons are typically Cancel and/or OK, with OK indicating the preferred or most likely action. However, if the options consist of specific actions such as Close or Wait rather than a confirmation or cancellation of the action described in the content, then all the buttons should be active verbs. As a rule, the dismissive action of a dialog is always on the left whereas the affirmative actions are on the right.&quot; 
</p>
<p>
This check looks for button bars and buttons which look like cancel buttons, and makes sure that these are on the left.
