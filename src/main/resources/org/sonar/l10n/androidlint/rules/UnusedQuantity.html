Android defines a number of different quantity strings, such as zero, one, few
and many. However, many languages do not distinguish grammatically between all
these different quantities.

This lint check looks at the quantity strings defined for each translation and
flags any quantity strings that are unused (because the language does not make
that quantity distinction, and Android will therefore not look it up.).

For example, in Chinese, only the other quantity is used, so even if you
provide translations for zero and one, these strings will not be returned when
getQuantityString() is called, even with 0 or 1.
