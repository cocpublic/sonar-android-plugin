On Windows, line endings are typically recorded as carriage return plus newline: \r\n.

This detector looks for invalid line endings with repeated carriage return characters (without newlines). Previous versions of the ADT plugin could accidentally introduce these into the file, and when editing the file, the editor could produce confusing visual artifacts.
