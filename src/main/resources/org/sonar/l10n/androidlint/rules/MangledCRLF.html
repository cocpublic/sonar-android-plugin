On Windows, line endings are typically recorded as carriage return plus
newline: \r\n.

This detector looks for invalid line endings with repeated carriage return
characters (without newlines). Previous versions of the ADT plugin could
accidentally introduce these into the file, and when editing the file, the
editor could produce confusing visual artifacts.
