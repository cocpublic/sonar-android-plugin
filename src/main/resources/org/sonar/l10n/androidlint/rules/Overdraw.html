If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom
theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will
be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it;
this is called "overdraw".

NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with
which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it's currently doing
that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can
incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then
wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.

If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider
making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme
instead of a root element background.

Of course it's possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want
it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance
if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image
or color as a custom theme background instead.
