This lint check looks for a folder name that is not a valid resource folder name; these will be ignored and not packaged by the Android Gradle build plugin. 
</p>
<p>
Note that the order of resources is very important; for example, you can't specify a language before a network code. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, note that to use 3 letter region codes, you have to use a special BCP 47 syntax: the prefix b+ followed by the BCP 47 language tag but with + as the individual separators instead of -. Therefore, for the BCP 47 language tag nl-ABW you have to use b+nl+ABW.
