<pre>
This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version
newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the
minSdkVersion attribute).

This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute.
However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality of
your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve
the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally
create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API
NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.

Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags can
be unused too, such as the new <tag> element in layouts introduced in API 21.
