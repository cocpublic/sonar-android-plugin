An id definition must be of the form @+id/yourname. The tools have not
rejected strings of the form @+foo/bar in the past, but that was an error, and
could lead to tricky errors because of the way the id integers are assigned.

If you really want to have different "scopes" for your id's, use prefixes
instead, such as login_button1 and login_button2.
