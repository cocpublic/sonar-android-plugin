<pre>NOTE: This issue is disabled by default!
You can enable it by adding --enable PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware

The <uses-permission> element should not require a permission that implies an
unsupported Chrome OS hardware feature. Google Play assumes that certain
hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware features
are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
corresponding uses-feature element with required="false" attribute.
