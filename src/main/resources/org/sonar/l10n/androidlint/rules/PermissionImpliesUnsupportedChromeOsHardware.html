NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware

<p>
The &lt;uses-permission&gt; element should not require a permission that implies an unsupported Chrome OS hardware feature. Google Play assumes that certain hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware features are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the corresponding uses-feature element with required=&quot;false&quot; attribute.
