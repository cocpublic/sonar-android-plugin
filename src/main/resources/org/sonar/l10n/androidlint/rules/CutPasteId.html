This lint check looks for cases where you have cut &amp; pasted calls to findViewById but have forgotten to update the R.id field. It's possible that your code is simply (redundantly) looking up the field repeatedly, but lint cannot distinguish that from a case where you for example want to initialize fields prev and next and you cut &amp; pasted findViewById(R.id.prev) and forgot to update the second initialization to R.id.next.
