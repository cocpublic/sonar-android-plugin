This lint check looks for cases where you have cut & pasted calls to
findViewById but have forgotten to update the R.id field. It's possible that
your code is simply (redundantly) looking up the field repeatedly, but lint
cannot distinguish that from a case where you for example want to initialize
fields prev and next and you cut & pasted findViewById(R.id.prev) and forgot
to update the second initialization to R.id.next.
