<pre>
The SSLCertificateSocketFactory.getInsecure() method returns an
SSLSocketFactory with all TLS/SSL security checks disabled, which could result
in insecure network traffic caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates
presented by peers. This method should be avoided unless needed for a special
circumstance such as debugging. Instead,
SSLCertificateSocketFactory.getDefault() should be used.
