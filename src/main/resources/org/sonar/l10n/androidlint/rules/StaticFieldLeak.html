A static field will leak contexts.

Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If
that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this reference
means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the
activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected.

Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these
longer running instances can cause leaks.

ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.
