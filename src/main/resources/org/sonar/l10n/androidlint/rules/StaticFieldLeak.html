A static field will leak contexts. 
</p>
<p>
Non-static inner classes have an implicit reference to their outer class. If that outer class is for example a Fragment or Activity, then this reference means that the long-running handler/loader/task will hold a reference to the activity which prevents it from getting garbage collected. 
</p>
<p>
Similarly, direct field references to activities and fragments from these longer running instances can cause leaks. 
</p>
<p>
ViewModel classes should never point to Views or non-application Contexts.
