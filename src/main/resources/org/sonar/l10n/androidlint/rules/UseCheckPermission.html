You normally want to use the result of checking a permission; these methods return whether the permission is held; they do not throw an error if the permission is not granted. Code which does not do anything with the return value probably meant to be calling the enforce methods instead, e.g. rather than Context#checkCallingPermission it should call Context#enforceCallingPermission.
