<pre>NOTE: This issue is disabled by default!
You can enable it by adding --enable BackButton

According to the Android Design Guide,

"Other platforms use an explicit back button with label to allow the user to
navigate up the application's hierarchy. Instead, Android uses the main action
bar's app icon for hierarchical navigation and the navigation bar's back
button for temporal navigation."
This check is not very sophisticated (it just looks for buttons with the label
"Back"), so it is disabled by default to not trigger on common scenarios like
pairs of Back/Next buttons to paginate through screens.
