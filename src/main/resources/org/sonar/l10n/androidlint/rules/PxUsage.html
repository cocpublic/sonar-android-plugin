For performance reasons and to keep the code simpler, the Android system uses
pixels as the standard unit for expressing dimension or coordinate values.
That means that the dimensions of a view are always expressed in the code
using pixels, but always based on the current screen density. For instance, if
myView.getWidth() returns 10, the view is 10 pixels wide on the current
screen, but on a device with a higher density screen, the value returned might
be 15. If you use pixel values in your application code to work with bitmaps
that are not pre-scaled for the current screen density, you might need to
scale the pixel values that you use in your code to match the un-scaled bitmap
source.
