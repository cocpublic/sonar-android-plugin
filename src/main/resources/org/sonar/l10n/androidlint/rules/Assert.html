Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be
used by Dalvik (adb shell setprop debug.assert 1), but note that this is not
implemented in ART (the newer runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is
ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform
conditional checking inside if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { } blocks. That constant
is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release
builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body
from the app.

For example, you can replace assert speed > 0 with if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &&
!(speed > 0)) { \
throw new AssertionError() }.

(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or
non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime
checks.)
