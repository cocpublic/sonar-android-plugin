<p>
Assertions are not checked at runtime. There are ways to request that they be used by Dalvik (adb shell setprop debug.assert 1), but note that this is not implemented in ART (the newer runtime), and even in Dalvik the property is ignored in many places and can not be relied upon. Instead, perform conditional checking inside if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) { } blocks. That constant is a static final boolean which is true in debug builds and false in release builds, and the Java compiler completely removes all code inside the if-body from the app.

For example, you can replace assert speed &gt; 0 with if (BuildConfig.DEBUG &amp;&amp; !(speed &gt; 0)) { \ throw new AssertionError() }.

(Note: This lint check does not flag assertions purely asserting nullness or non-nullness; these are typically more intended for tools usage than runtime checks.)
