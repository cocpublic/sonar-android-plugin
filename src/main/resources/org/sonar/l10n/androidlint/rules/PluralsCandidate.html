This lint check looks for potential errors in internationalization where you
have translated a message which involves a quantity and it looks like other
parts of the string may need grammatical changes.

For example, rather than something like this:
  <string name="try_again">Try again in %d seconds.</string>
you should be using a plural:
   <plurals name="try_again">
        <item quantity="one">Try again in %d second</item>
        <item quantity="other">Try again in %d seconds</item>
    </plurals>
This will ensure that in other languages the right set of translations are
provided for the different quantity classes.

(This check depends on some heuristics, so it may not accurately determine
whether a string really should be a quantity. You can use tools:ignore to
filter out false positives.
