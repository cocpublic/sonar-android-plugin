Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with
quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write
"1 book", but for any other quantity we'd write "n books". This distinction
between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer
distinctions.

This lint check looks at each translation of a <plural> and makes sure that
all the quantity strings considered by the given language are provided by this
translation.

For example, an English translation must provide a string for quantity="one".
Similarly, a Czech translation must provide a string for quantity="few".
