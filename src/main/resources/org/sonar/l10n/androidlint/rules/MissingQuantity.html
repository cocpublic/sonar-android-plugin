<p>
Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write &quot;1 book&quot;, but for any other quantity we'd write &quot;n books&quot;. This distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.

This lint check looks at each translation of a &lt;plural&gt; and makes sure that all the quantity strings considered by the given language are provided by this translation.

<p>
For example, an English translation must provide a string for quantity=&quot;one&quot;. Similarly, a Czech translation must provide a string for quantity=&quot;few&quot;.
