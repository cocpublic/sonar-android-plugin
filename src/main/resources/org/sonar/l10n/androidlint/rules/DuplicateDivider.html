<p>
Older versions of the RecyclerView library did not include a divider decorator, but one was provided as a sample in the support demos. This divider class has been widely copy/pasted into various projects.

<p>
In recent versions of the support library, the divider decorator is now included, so you can replace custom copies with the &quot;built-in&quot; version, android.support.v7.widget.DividerItemDecoration.
