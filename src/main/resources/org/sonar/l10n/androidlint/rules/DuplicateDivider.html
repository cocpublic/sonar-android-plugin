<pre>
Older versions of the RecyclerView library did not include a divider
decorator, but one was provided as a sample in the support demos. This divider
class has been widely copy/pasted into various projects.

In recent versions of the support library, the divider decorator is now
included, so you can replace custom copies with the "built-in" version,
android.support.v7.widget.DividerItemDecoration.
