<p>
From the java.util.Locale documentation: &quot;Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. The Hebrew (&quot;he&quot;) language code is rewritten as &quot;iw&quot;, Indonesian (&quot;id&quot;) as &quot;in&quot;, and Yiddish (&quot;yi&quot;) as &quot;ji&quot;. This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods. 
</p>
<p>
Because of this, if you add your localized resources in for example values-he they will not be used, since the system will look for values-iw instead. 
</p>
<p>
To work around this, place your resources in a values folder using the deprecated language code instead.
