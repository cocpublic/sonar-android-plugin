Vector icons require API 21, but when using Android Gradle plugin 1.4 or
higher, vectors placed in the drawable folder are automatically moved to
drawable-*dpi-v21 and a bitmap image is generated each drawable-*dpi folder
instead, for backwards compatibility (provided minSdkVersion is less than
21.).

However, there are some limitations to this vector image generation, and this
lint check flags elements and attributes that are not fully supported. You
should manually check whether the generated output is acceptable for those
older devices.
