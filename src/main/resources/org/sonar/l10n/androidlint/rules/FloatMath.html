In older versions of Android, using android.util.FloatMath was recommended for performance reasons when operating on floats. However, on modern hardware doubles are just as fast as float (though they take more memory), and in recent versions of Android, FloatMath is actually slower than using java.lang.Math due to the way the JIT optimizes java.lang.Math. Therefore, you should use Math instead of FloatMath if you are only targeting Froyo and above.
