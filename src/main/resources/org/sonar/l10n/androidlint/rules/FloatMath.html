In older versions of Android, using android.util.FloatMath was recommended for
performance reasons when operating on floats. However, on modern hardware
doubles are just as fast as float (though they take more memory), and in
recent versions of Android, FloatMath is actually slower than using
java.lang.Math due to the way the JIT optimizes java.lang.Math. Therefore, you
should use Math instead of FloatMath if you are only targeting Froyo and
above.
