Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the
contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget
such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe
the user interface.

Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do
not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility
content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a
tools:ignore="ContentDescription" attribute.

Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the
contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the
hint. See

ial-cases.
