<p>
Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the contentDescription attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface. 
</p>
<p>
Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute. 
</p>
<p>
Note that for text fields, you should not set both the hint and the contentDescription attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the hint.
