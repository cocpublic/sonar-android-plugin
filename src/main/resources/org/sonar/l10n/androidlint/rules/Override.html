Suppose you are building against Android API 8, and you've subclassed
Activity. In your subclass you add a new method called isDestroyed(). At some
later point, a method of the same name and signature is added to Android. Your
method will now override the Android method, and possibly break its contract.
Your method is not calling super.isDestroyed(), since your compilation target
doesn't know about the method.

The above scenario is what this lint detector looks for. The above example is
real, since isDestroyed() was added in API 17, but it will be true for any
method you have added to a subclass of an Android class where your build
target is lower than the version the method was introduced in.

To fix this, either rename your method, or if you are really trying to augment
the builtin method if available, switch to a higher build target where you can
deliberately add @Override on your overriding method, and call super if
appropriate etc.
