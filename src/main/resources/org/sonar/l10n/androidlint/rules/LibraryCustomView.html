<pre>
When using a custom view with custom attributes in a library project, the
layout must use the special namespace http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto
instead of a URI which includes the library project's own package. This will
be used to automatically adjust the namespace of the attributes when the
library resources are merged into the application project.
