Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
reasons:

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
making changes)

* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new
translations for existing string resources.

There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
resource lookup.
