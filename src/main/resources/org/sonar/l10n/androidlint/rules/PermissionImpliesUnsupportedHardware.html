The &lt;uses-permission&gt; element should not require a permission that implies an unsupported TV hardware feature. Google Play assumes that certain hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware features are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the corresponding uses-feature element with required=&quot;false&quot; attribute.
