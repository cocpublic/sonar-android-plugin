<p>
The &lt;application&gt; tag should appear after the elements which declare which version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting applied correctly) when the &lt;application&gt; tag appears before some of these other elements, so it's best to order your manifest in the logical dependency order.
