The <application> tag should appear after the elements which declare which
version you need, which features you need, which libraries you need, and so
on. In the past there have been subtle bugs (such as themes not getting
applied correctly) when the <application> tag appears before some of these
other elements, so it's best to order your manifest in the logical dependency
order.
