<pre>
The <uses-library> element should be defined as a direct child of the
<application> tag, not the <manifest> tag or an <activity> tag. Similarly, a
<uses-sdk> tag must be declared at the root level, and so on. This check looks
for incorrect declaration locations in the manifest, and complains if an
element is found in the wrong place.
