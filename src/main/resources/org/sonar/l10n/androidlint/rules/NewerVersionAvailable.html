You can enable it by adding --enable NewerVersionAvailable

This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is similar
to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions available in
the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any MavenCentral
dependency, and connects to the library every time, which makes it more
flexible but also much slower.
