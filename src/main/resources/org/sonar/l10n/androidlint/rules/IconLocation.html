The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as
shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to drawable-mdpi and consider
providing higher and lower resolution versions in drawable-ldpi, drawable-hdpi
and drawable-xhdpi. If the icon really is density independent (for example a
solid color) you can place it in drawable-nodpi.
