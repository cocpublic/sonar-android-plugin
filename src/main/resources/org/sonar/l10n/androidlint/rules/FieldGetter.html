NOTE: This issue is disabled by default! You can enable it by adding --enable FieldGetter

Accessing a field within the class that defines a getter for that field is at least 3 times faster than calling the getter. For simple getters that do nothing other than return the field, you might want to just reference the local field directly instead.

NOTE: As of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), this optimization is performed automatically by Dalvik, so there is no need to change your code; this is only relevant if you are targeting older versions of Android.
