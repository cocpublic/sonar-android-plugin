From the action bar documentation:
"It's important that you always define android:title for each menu item — even
if you don't declare that the title appear with the action item — for three
reasons:

* If there's not enough room in the action bar for the action item, the menu
item appears in the overflow menu and only the title appears.
* Screen readers for sight-impaired users read the menu item's title.
* If the action item appears with only the icon, a user can long-press the
item to reveal a tool-tip that displays the action item's title.
The android:icon is always optional, but recommended.
