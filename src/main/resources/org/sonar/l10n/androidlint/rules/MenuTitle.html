<p>
From the action bar documentation: &quot;It's important that you always define android:title for each menu item &mdash; even if you don't declare that the title appear with the action item &mdash; for three reasons: 
</p>
<p>

<br>* If there's not enough room in the action bar for the action item, the menu item appears in the overflow menu and only the title appears. 
<br>* Screen readers for sight-impaired users read the menu item's title. 
<br>* If the action item appears with only the icon, a user can long-press the item to reveal a tool-tip that displays the action item's title. The android:icon is always optional, but recommended.
