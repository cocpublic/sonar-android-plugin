<p>
The properties compileSdkVersion, minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion are usually numbers, but can be strings when you are using an add-on (in the case of compileSdkVersion) or a preview platform (for the other two properties).

However, you can not use a number as a string (e.g. &quot;19&quot; instead of 19); that will result in a platform not found error message at build/sync time.
