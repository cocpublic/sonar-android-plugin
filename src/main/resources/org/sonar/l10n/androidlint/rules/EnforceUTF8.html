XML supports encoding in a wide variety of character sets. However, not all
tools handle the XML encoding attribute correctly, and nearly all Android apps
use UTF-8, so by using UTF-8 you can protect yourself against subtle bugs when
using non-ASCII characters.

In particular, the Android Gradle build system will merge resource XML files
assuming the resource files are using UTF-8 encoding.
