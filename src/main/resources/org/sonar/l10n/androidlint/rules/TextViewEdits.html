Using a <TextView> to input text is generally an error, you should be using
<EditText> instead.  EditText is a subclass of TextView, and some of the
editing support is provided by TextView, so it's possible to set some
input-related properties on a TextView. However, using a TextView along with
input attributes is usually a cut & paste error. To input text you should be
using <EditText>.

This check also checks subclasses of TextView, such as Button and CheckBox,
since these have the same issue: they should not be used with editable
attributes.
