Using a &lt;TextView&gt; to input text is generally an error, you should be using &lt;EditText&gt; instead.  EditText is a subclass of TextView, and some of the editing support is provided by TextView, so it's possible to set some input-related properties on a TextView. However, using a TextView along with input attributes is usually a cut &amp; paste error. To input text you should be using &lt;EditText&gt;.

This check also checks subclasses of TextView, such as Button and CheckBox, since these have the same issue: they should not be used with editable attributes.
