<pre>NOTE: This issue is disabled by default!
You can enable it by adding --enable UnsupportedChromeOsHardware

The <uses-feature> element should not require this unsupported Chrome OS
hardware feature. Any uses-feature not explicitly marked with required="false"
is necessary on the device to be installed on. Ensure that any features that
might prevent it from being installed on a Chrome OS device are reviewed and
marked as not required in the manifest.
