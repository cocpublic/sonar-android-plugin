When you reference an inner class in a manifest file, you must use '$' instead
of '.' as the separator character, i.e. Outer$Inner instead of Outer.Inner.

(If you get this warning for a class which is not actually an inner class,
it's because you are using uppercase characters in your package name, which is
not conventional.)
