<pre>
This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs being
used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to access those
APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then the program will
crash.

Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with targetSdkVersion 23),
client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception if
the user rejects the request for permission at runtime.
