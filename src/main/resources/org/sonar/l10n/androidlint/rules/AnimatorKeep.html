<p>
When you use property animators, properties can be accessed via reflection. Those methods should be annotated with @Keep to ensure that during release builds, the methods are not potentially treated as unused and removed, or treated as internal only and get renamed to something shorter.

This check will also flag other potential reflection problems it encounters, such as a missing property, wrong argument types, etc.
