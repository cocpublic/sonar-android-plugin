Bitmaps that appear in drawable-nodpi folders will not be scaled by the Android framework. If a drawable resource of the same name appears both in a -nodpi folder as well as a dpi folder such as drawable-hdpi, then the behavior is ambiguous and probably not intentional. Delete one or the other, or use different names for the icons.
