From the Fragment documentation:
Every fragment must have an empty constructor, so it can be instantiated when
restoring its activity's state. It is strongly recommended that subclasses do
not have other constructors with parameters, since these constructors will not
be called when the fragment is re-instantiated; instead, arguments can be
supplied by the caller with setArguments(Bundle) and later retrieved by the
Fragment with getArguments().
