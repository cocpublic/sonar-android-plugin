If you do not specify an android:id or an android:tag attribute on a
<fragment> element, then if the activity is restarted (for example for an
orientation rotation) you may lose state. From the fragment documentation:

"Each fragment requires a unique identifier that the system can use to restore
the fragment if the activity is restarted (and which you can use to capture
the fragment to perform transactions, such as remove it).

* Supply the android:id attribute with a unique ID.
* Supply the android:tag attribute with a unique string.
If you provide neither of the previous two, the system uses the ID of the
container view.
