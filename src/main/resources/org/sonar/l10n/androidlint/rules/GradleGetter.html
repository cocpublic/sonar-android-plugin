Gradle will let you replace specific constants in your build scripts with
method calls, so you can for example dynamically compute a version string
based on your current version control revision number, rather than hardcoding
a number.

When computing a version name, it's tempting to for example call the method to
do that getVersionName. However, when you put that method call inside the
defaultConfig block, you will actually be calling the Groovy getter for the
versionName property instead. Therefore, you need to name your method
something which does not conflict with the existing implicit getters. Consider
using compute as a prefix instead of get.
