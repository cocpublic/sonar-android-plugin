<p>
In SQLite, any column can store any data type; the declared type for a column is more of a hint as to what the data should be cast to when stored. 
</p>
<p>
There are many ways to store a string. TEXT, VARCHAR, CHARACTER and CLOB are string types, but `STRING` is not. Columns defined as STRING are actually numeric. 
</p>
<p>
If you try to store a value in a numeric column, SQLite will try to cast it to a float or an integer before storing. If it can't, it will just store it as a string. 
</p>
<p>
This can lead to some subtle bugs. For example, when SQLite encounters a string like 1234567e1234, it will parse it as a float, but the result will be out of range for floating point numbers, so Inf will be stored! Similarly, strings that look like integers will lose leading zeroes. 
</p>
<p>
To fix this, you can change your schema to use a TEXT type instead.
