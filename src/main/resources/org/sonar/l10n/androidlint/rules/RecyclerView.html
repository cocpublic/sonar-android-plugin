<pre>
RecyclerView will not call onBindViewHolder again when the position of the
item changes in the data set unless the item itself is invalidated or the new
position cannot be determined.

For this reason, you should only use the position parameter while acquiring
the related data item inside this method, and should not keep a copy of it.

If you need the position of an item later on (e.g. in a click listener), use
getAdapterPosition() which will have the updated adapter position.
