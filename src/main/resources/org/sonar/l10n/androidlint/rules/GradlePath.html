Gradle build scripts are meant to be cross platform, so file paths use
Unix-style path separators (a forward slash) rather than Windows path
separators (a backslash). Similarly, to keep projects portable and repeatable,
avoid using absolute paths on the system; keep files within the project
instead. To share code between projects, consider creating an android-library
and an AAR dependency
