Improper validation of app signatures could lead to issues where a malicious
app submits itself to the Play Store with both its real certificate and a fake
certificate and gains access to functionality or information it shouldn't have
due to another application only checking for the fake certificate and ignoring
the rest. Please make sure to validate all signatures returned by this
method.
