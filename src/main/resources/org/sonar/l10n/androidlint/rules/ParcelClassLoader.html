<p>
The documentation for Parcel#readParcelable(ClassLoader) (and its variations) says that you can pass in null to pick up the default class loader. However, that ClassLoader is a system class loader and is not able to find classes in your own application. 
</p>
<p>
If you are writing your own classes into the Parcel (not just SDK classes like String and so on), then you should supply a ClassLoader for your application instead; a simple way to obtain one is to just call getClass().getClassLoader() from your own class.
