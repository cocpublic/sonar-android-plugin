You can enable it by adding --enable LogConditional

The BuildConfig class (available in Tools 17) provides a constant, "DEBUG",
which indicates whether the code is being built in release mode or in debug
mode. In release mode, you typically want to strip out all the logging calls.
Since the compiler will automatically remove all code which is inside a "if
(false)" check, surrounding your logging calls with a check for
BuildConfig.DEBUG is a good idea.

If you really intend for the logging to be present in release mode, you can
suppress this warning with a @SuppressLint annotation for the intentional
logging calls.
