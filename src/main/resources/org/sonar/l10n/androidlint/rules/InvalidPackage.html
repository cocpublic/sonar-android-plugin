This check scans through libraries looking for calls to APIs that are not
included in Android.

When you create Android projects, the classpath is set up such that you can
only access classes in the API packages that are included in Android. However,
if you add other projects to your libs/ folder, there is no guarantee that
those .jar files were built with an Android specific classpath, and in
particular, they could be accessing unsupported APIs such as java.applet.

This check scans through library jars and looks for references to API packages
that are not included in Android and flags these. This is only an error if
your code calls one of the library classes which wind up referencing the
unsupported package.
