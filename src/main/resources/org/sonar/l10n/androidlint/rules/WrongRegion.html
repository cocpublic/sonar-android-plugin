Android uses the letter codes ISO 639-1 for languages, and the letter codes
ISO 3166-1 for the region codes. In many cases, the language code and the
country where the language is spoken is the same, but it is also often not the
case. For example, while 'se' refers to Sweden, where Swedish is spoken, the
language code for Swedish is not se (which refers to the Northern Sami
language), the language code is sv. And similarly the region code for sv is El
Salvador.

This lint check looks for suspicious language and region combinations, to help
catch cases where you've accidentally used the wrong language or region code.
Lint knows about the most common regions where a language is spoken, and if a
folder combination is not one of these, it is flagged as suspicious.

Note however that it may not be an error: you can theoretically have speakers
of any language in any region and want to target that with your resources, so
this check is aimed at tracking down likely mistakes, not to enforce a
specific set of region and language combinations.
