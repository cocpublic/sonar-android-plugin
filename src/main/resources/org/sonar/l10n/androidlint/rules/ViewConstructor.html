<p>
Some layout tools (such as the Android layout editor) need to find a constructor with one of the following signatures: 
<br>* View(Context context) 
<br>* View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) 
<br>* View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle) 
</p>
<p>
If your custom view needs to perform initialization which does not apply when used in a layout editor, you can surround the given code with a check to see if View#isInEditMode() is false, since that method will return false at runtime but true within a user interface editor.
