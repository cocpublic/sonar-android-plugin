Some layout tools (such as the Android layout editor) need to find a
constructor with one of the following signatures:
* View(Context context)
* View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs)
* View(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle)

If your custom view needs to perform initialization which does not apply when
used in a layout editor, you can surround the given code with a check to see
if View#isInEditMode() is false, since that method will return false at
runtime but true within a user interface editor.
