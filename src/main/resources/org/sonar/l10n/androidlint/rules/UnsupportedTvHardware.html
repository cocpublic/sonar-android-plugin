The <uses-feature> element should not require this unsupported TV hardware
feature. Any uses-feature not explicitly marked with required="false" is
necessary on the device to be installed on. Ensure that any features that
might prevent it from being installed on a TV device are reviewed and marked
as not required in the manifest.
