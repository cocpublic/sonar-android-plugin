The &lt;uses-feature&gt; element should not require this unsupported TV hardware feature. Any uses-feature not explicitly marked with required=&quot;false&quot; is necessary on the device to be installed on. Ensure that any features that might prevent it from being installed on a TV device are reviewed and marked as not required in the manifest.
