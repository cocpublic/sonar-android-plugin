<pre>
If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared in
one language should also be translated in all other languages.

If the string should not be translated, you can add the attribute
translatable="false" on the <string> element, or you can define all your
non-translatable strings in a resource file called donottranslate.xml. Or, you
can ignore the issue with a tools:ignore="MissingTranslation" attribute.

By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset
of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require
all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable
ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS.

You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in
your res/values/ folder by specifying tools:locale="languageCode" for the root
<resources> element in your resource file. (The tools prefix refers to the
namespace declaration http://schemas.android.com/tools.)
