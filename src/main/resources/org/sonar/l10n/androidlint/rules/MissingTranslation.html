<p>
If an application has more than one locale, then all the strings declared in one language should also be translated in all other languages. 
</p>
<p>
If the string should not be translated, you can add the attribute translatable=&quot;false&quot; on the &lt;string&gt; element, or you can define all your non-translatable strings in a resource file called donottranslate.xml. Or, you can ignore the issue with a tools:ignore=&quot;MissingTranslation&quot; attribute. 
</p>
<p>
By default this detector allows regions of a language to just provide a subset of the strings and fall back to the standard language strings. You can require all regions to provide a full translation by setting the environment variable ANDROID_LINT_COMPLETE_REGIONS. 
</p>
<p>
You can tell lint (and other tools) which language is the default language in your res/values/ folder by specifying tools:locale=&quot;languageCode&quot; for the root &lt;resources&gt; element in your resource file. (The tools prefix refers to the namespace declaration http://schemas.android.com/tools.)
