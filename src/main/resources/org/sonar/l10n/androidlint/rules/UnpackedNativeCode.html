This app loads native libraries using System.loadLibrary().

Consider adding android:extractNativeLibs=&quot;false&quot; to the &lt;application&gt; tag in AndroidManifest.xml. Starting with Android 6.0, this will make installation faster, the app will take up less space on the device and updates will have smaller download sizes.
