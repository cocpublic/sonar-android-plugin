You can enable it by adding --enable UnpackedNativeCode

This app loads native libraries using System.loadLibrary().

Consider adding android:extractNativeLibs="false" to the <application> tag in
AndroidManifest.xml. Starting with Android 6.0, this will make installation
faster, the app will take up less space on the device and updates will have
smaller download sizes.
