Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major
screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra high). This lint check
identifies icons which do not have complete coverage across the densities.

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi
density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable
ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true. For more information on current density usage,
see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html
