In general, application native code should only be placed in the application's
library directory, not in other locations such as the res or assets
directories. Placing the code in the library directory provides increased
assurance that the code will not be tampered with after application
installation. Application developers should use the features of their
development environment to place application native libraries into the lib
directory of their compiled APKs. Embedding non-shared library native
executables into applications should be avoided when possible.
