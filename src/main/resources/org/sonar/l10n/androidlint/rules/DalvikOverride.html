The Android virtual machine will treat a package private method in one class as overriding a package private method in its super class, even if they are in separate packages. This may be surprising, but for compatibility reasons the behavior has not been changed (yet).

If you really did intend for this method to override the other, make the method protected instead.

If you did not intend the override, consider making the method private, or changing its name or signature.
