<pre>
The Android virtual machine will treat a package private method in one class
as overriding a package private method in its super class, even if they are in
separate packages. This may be surprising, but for compatibility reasons the
behavior has not been changed (yet).

If you really did intend for this method to override the other, make the
method protected instead.

If you did not intend the override, consider making the method private, or
changing its name or signature.
