Google Play services SDK's can be selectively included, which enables a
smaller APK size. Consider declaring dependencies on individual Google Play
services SDK's. If you are using Firebase API's
(http://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), Android Studio's Tools â†’
Firebase assistant window can automatically add just the dependencies needed
for each feature.
