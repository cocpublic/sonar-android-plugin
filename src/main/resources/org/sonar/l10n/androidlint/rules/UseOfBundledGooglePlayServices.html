Google Play services SDK's can be selectively included, which enables a smaller APK size. Consider declaring dependencies on individual Google Play services SDK's. If you are using Firebase API's (http://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup), Android Studio's Tools &rarr; Firebase assistant window can automatically add just the dependencies needed for each feature.
