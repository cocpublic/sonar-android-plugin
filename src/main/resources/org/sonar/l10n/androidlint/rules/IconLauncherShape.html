<pre>
According to the Android Design Guide
(http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html) your launcher
icons should "use a distinct silhouette", a "three-dimensional, front view,
with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some
depth."

The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled
square.
