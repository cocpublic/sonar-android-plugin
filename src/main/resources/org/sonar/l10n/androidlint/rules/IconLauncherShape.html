According to the Android Design Guide (http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html) your launcher icons should &quot;use a distinct silhouette&quot;, a &quot;three-dimensional, front view, with a slight perspective as if viewed from above, so that users perceive some depth.&quot;

The unique silhouette implies that your launcher icon should not be a filled square.
