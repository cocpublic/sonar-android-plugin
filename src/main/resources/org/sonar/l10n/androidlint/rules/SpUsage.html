<p>
When setting text sizes, you should normally use sp, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the dp unit, but it is also scaled by the user's font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user's preference.

There are cases where you might need to use dp; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user's font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible.
