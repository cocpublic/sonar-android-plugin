<p>
When SSLCertificateSocketFactory.createSocket() is called with an InetAddress as the first parameter, TLS/SSL hostname verification is not performed, which could result in insecure network traffic caused by trusting arbitrary hostnames in TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers. In this case, developers must ensure that the InetAddress is explicitly verified against the certificate through other means, such as by calling `SSLCertificateSocketFactory.getDefaultHostnameVerifier() to get a HostnameVerifier and calling HostnameVerifier.verify().
